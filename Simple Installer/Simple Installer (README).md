# What is Simple Installer?

As the name suggests, Simple Installer is a Python based tool to download things simply and quickly straigh from the internet into your Downloads folder.

You simply paste or type in the raw information of the script as a URL and press Download.

# How to use?

### Source Code:

- To use the Source Code version of this Python Script, you will need to install a functional version of Python. [This](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is a link to the most recent Python versions.
- Than you will need to run two commands in the Python Terminal: `pip install customtkinter` and `pip install requests`. These commands will install the required files that Simple Installer uses.
- Now run the script using your Python terminal or in any code application that supports running scripts like **Visual Studio.**

### Executable:

- To use the Executable version all you need to do is download. The only reason that the **.exe** is attached is for simplicity of use for this tool. This means you wont have to download Python, run the commands in the Python Terminal and run the file manually but instead you just run the **.exe** and it works.
- The problem with using the Executable version is that it was built using **pyinstaller** which alot of Python-based viruses use to hide script from the user. This is a problem because this will bring false-positives when you scan the file in things like **Virus Total** or with your installed Anti-Virus. Although the **.exe** is entirely safe, you can just run the source code if your anti-virus is receiving false positives.
